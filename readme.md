# Resume

This project contains my resume that is dynamically generated using [React PDF](https://react-pdf.org/) with the use if [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev).



# Viewing the Project

Make sure to have Node 18+ installed.

1. Install all dependencies with `yarn`
2. Run the Vite development server with `yarn dev`
3. Open up `src/config/resume.ts` and edit the resume!
4. To view changes, refresh your browser! (hot loading doesn't work for react-pdf)
5. Profit!
